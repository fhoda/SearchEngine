Information Retrieval Homework 5

Creates an inverted index given a corpus.

Ranks the documents using BM25 Ranking.

Allows querying and returning results based on ranking.

Steps to use:
1) Make sure "tcorpus.txt" and "queries.txt" are present within the same directory as the SearchEngine.java, TermFrequency.java, and BM25.java files.
2) Run "javac *.java" from the terminal
3) Run "java SearchEngine". The java program will read in corpus from tcorpus.txt and the queries from queries.txt, and then output to 7 different query files (this is for readbility)
4) Enjoy!
